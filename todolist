# TODO list

# Download PTP download history
 # Parse out release/source information wherever possible
# Figure out way to mark director's cut/commentary/criterion/whatever
# Move files to external storage place
  # Create symlinks for people to actually browse through
  # Need to figure out how to make Samba happy with that...
# Make movie folder and symlink folder only writable by app. Put new files in staging area to process
# Handle movies with multiple files (documentaries, sets the stage for TV support)
# Eventually: hook up to butter interface?
  # Would be great to have Gazelle-style filtering though...
